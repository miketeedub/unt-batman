# unt-batman
shell script that connects one wifi adapter to enterprise network and configures the other for BATMAN-adv


I wrote this shell script to enable a raspberry pi to connect to both the school WiFi and create a mesh network with B.A.T.M.A.N-adv.

To Run:

$ ./batsetup.sh user_name your_password ip_address_you_want_for_BATMAN

adding an IP address is optional
